""" Mystery number
  the computer is going to choose a random number within a range (1 to 10) for example

  #generate a random number and store in a variable
  
  #repeatedly ask the player to input a number until he finds the right answer
  
      #if the number is higher then the mystery number
        #telling the player to try a smaller number
        
      #if the number is lower then the mystery number
        #telling the player to try a biger number

#if the player finds the number we stop asking him for a number
